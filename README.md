# OSrelatedLearning-and-dataStructures
 building a base interacting with the client, and data structures that the client can use
 I want to implement
 a array stack.
 and a linked list stack.
 then an ADTstack.

 ..

 also try an making an arena ive heard its better to malloc and free in blocks rather than keep track of
 each indiviual piece of memory. (freeing all with one free call);



 naming conventions im going to use :

 MY_DEFINE

 MyType

 my_function()

 my_variable
